# CPF-validator-generator

CPF is a unique number used as identification everyone has in Brazil, but it has some parameters to be accepted as one. With that parameters, I made a validator that can test them and if is true, it validates your CPF. And with that same logic, I used the base code to make a generator, where he adapts a 11 digit number to a valid CPF.
